 * Description: This API will convert a UTF-16 string to upper or lower case.
 *              Currently, the ps_locale parameter is reserved for future,
 *              and only NULL is accpetable. In this case, it will always
 *              assume that ASCII is used when doing conversion.
 *
 * Inputs:  ui4_dst_len  The buffer size of w2s_dst. The unit is the number
 *                       of UTF16_T characters.
 *          w2s_src      String to be converted.
 *          ps_locale    Locale string. Reserved for future.
 *          e_case       UC_CASE type enumeration. Upper or Lower case.
 *
 * Outputs: w2s_dst      The converted string.
 *
 * Returns: UCR_NO_SUPPORT          Specified locale is not supported.
 *          UCR_NO_ENOUGH_BUFFER    Size of w2s_dst is not enough.
 *          UCR_NO_MEMORY           Run out of system memory.
 *          UCR_CNV_FAIL            Fail to convert between UTF-8 and UTF-16
 *          UCR_OK                  Success
