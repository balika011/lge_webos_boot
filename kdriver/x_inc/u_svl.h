 *  @par
 *  @section secMW_SVL_1  1. Introduction
 *  @par
 *      Service lists are databases storing records with information describing
 *      services.
 *      The SVL (Service List) module under Middleware manages the SVL databases and
 *      provide API to create, delete, modify, store to/load from flash the SVL as
 *      well as various query functions such as get_rec_by_XX and iterate_rec to
 *      return matching service list records with specified condition.
 *      SVL is one component of SVL/TSL/NWL databases, which are filled with data by
 *      @ref groupMW_SVL_BLDR "SVL Builder" after channel scan.
 *  @par
 *  @section secMW_SVL_2  2. Concept
 *  @par
 *      For better understand, readers would better bear knowledge of MPEG-2 PSI,
 *      DVB SI, ATSC PSIP and related DTV standards. Here several basic entities in
 *      different layers are described in brief.
 *  @par
 *      -   <b>Transport Stream</b>:
 *      <br>
 *      a stream definition according to 13818-1 for transmitting one or more
 *      programs in error-prone environments. PSI and PES are multiplexed by means of
 *      188-byte or 204-byte TS packets. One TS corresponds to 1 physical channel.
 *  
 *  @par
 *      -   <b>Service</b>:
 *      <br>
 *      sequence of programs under the control of a broadcaster which can be
 *      broadcast as part of a schedule (DVB). One service corresponds to one logical channel.
 *      Services contain ES (and necessary SI to group them together), and are
 *      multiplexed into TS. A service is made up of events over time.
 *  
 *  @par
 *      -   <b>Component</b>:
 *      <br>
 *      one or more entities which together make up an event (DVB), by
 *      means of elementary streams (ES) of video / audio / data. One component corresponds to one ES.
 *  
 *  @par
 *      -   <b>Network</b>:
 *      <br>
 *      collection of MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) multiplexes transmitted on
 *      a single delivery system (DVB). One network corresponds to one service provider on a
 *      specific tuner source (terrestrial / cable / satellite).
 *  
 *  @par
 *      -   <b>Broadcaster</b>:
 *      <br>
 *      organization which assembles a sequence of events or programs to
 *      be delivered to the viewer based upon a schedule (DVB). One broadcaster corresponds to one
 *      service provider.

 *  @subsection ssecMW_SVL_3_1  3.1. The Three Lists
 *  @par
 *      The SVL is one component of SVL/TSL/NWL databases.
 *      -   @ref groupMW_SVL "SVL" stores information about services.
 *      -   @ref groupMW_TSL "TSL" stores information about transport stream and tuning parameters.
 *      -   @ref groupMW_NWL "NWL" stores information about networks.
 *  
 *  @par
 *      These three lists correspond to the three layers of digital broadcasting
 *      service delivery model in DVB.  As there is no concept of networks in ATSC,
 *      NWL is not used in US models.
 *  @par
 *      Due to the intrinsic hierarchical relation among services, transport streams
 *      and networks, there are also similar reference relations between SVL and TSL,
 *      TSL and NWL.  As a network can contain multiple transport streams, a NWL
 *      record can be referred to by one or many TSL records. Similarly, as a
 *      transport stream can contain multiple services, a TSL record can be referred
 *      to by one or many SVL records. On the contrary, a SVL record must refer to one
 *      and only one TSL record, and similarly a TSL record must refer to one and only
 *      one NWL record if the transport stream is in a DVB network.
 *  @par
 *      Any of SVL / TSL / NWL list can have multiple instances, which are identified by
 *      list ID's.
 *  @par
 *      The following table is the overview of three main databases in Middleware,
 *      namely @ref groupMW_TSL "TSL" , @ref groupMW_SVL "SVL" and @ref groupMW_SCDB "SCDB" .
 *      @ref groupMW_NWL "NWL" is not described here as it is only used for DVB scanning
 *      and is transparent to Applications.

 *  @par
 *      As described before, the SVL object stores information of services, such as
 *      MPEG-2 program number, transport stream id, channel number, and other
 *      information that describes a service.
 *  @par
 *      Each service record also contains reference to a TSL (Transport Stream List)
 *      object and a TSL record stored in that TSL object.  The TSL record contains
 *      descriptions for the TS (broadcast type, medium, ON ID, TS ID, etc), as well
 *      as tuning related parameters (frequency, modulation mode, etc) for a given
 *      service.
 *  @par
 *      The NWL (Network list) stores information about a network, e.g., network id
 *      and network name.
 *  @par
 *      The three lists SVL/TSL/NWL provide to the user similar interfaces to
 *      manipulate the database, such as creating, deleting the database, adding,

 *      The header section contains generic information about this service. The data

 *  @par
 *      For Network Mask, currently it only represents `virtual networks'. The `real
 *      networks' mentioned in the previous section are in fact different broadcast
 *      media, which are represented by multiple instances of SVL/TSL/NWL database,
 *      and services belonging to different broadcast media are stored into different
 *      Service Lists. The virtual networks are designated by the user, and could be
 *      regarded as a label applied to the service for classification. See @ref ssecMW_SVL_3_3 for
 *      details.
 *  @par
 *      The network mask value could also be used as matching criteria for searching
 *      records, as described in the previous section.
 *  @par
 *      A new mask variable, the option mask, has been created in order to make space
 *      for the increasing number of virtual networks defined.  `Labels' that are only
 *      used as a control flag and not used for classifying or searching should be
 *      defined as `virtual options' instead of virtual networks, in order not to
 *      occupy one of the only 32 bits in the network mask.
 *  @par
 *      All the abovementioned interpretation are implemented as macros in
 *      @ref groupMW_SVL_BLDR "u_sb.h" .  SVL itself does not care about the value of data

 *  @subsection ssecMW_SVL_3_6  3.6. Persistent Storage
 *  @par
 *      This section describes saving and re-loading a SVL object to or from the file
 *      system.  The SVL API's provide functions to write the content of service list
 *      (e.g., data records and metadata) to file, and to create a service list object
 *      by loading the content from a previous saved file.  Additional API's allows
 *      deleting SVL file on storage, and finding out what SVL files are available.
 *  @par
 *      The SVL persistent storage API will utilize @ref groupMW_CDB "CDB"
 *      @ref db_save_to_file "save" / @ref db_load_from_file "load" API's to write/read

 *      c_svl_fs_del(), c_svl_fs_qry(), the first argument specifies the file path to
 *      store SVL records.  The file path specified must be one of the two file types:

 *      In file system related API's, e.g., x_svl_fs_load(), x_svl_fs_store(),

 *      a regular directory, or a RAW character file.
 *  @endif
 *  @par
 *      If the path specified is a regular directory, then SVL library will
 *      create/open a file under that directory to load/store the SVL object, one SVL
 *      object per file.  If the path specified is a RAW character file, then the SVL
 *      library will write/read the SVL object to/from the RAW file.   Multiple SVL
 *      objects can be store in a single RAW file.
 *  @par
 *      In MediaTek turnkey solution, the channel list file path specified by AP is
 *      defined as <b>DUAL_BANK_SVL_TSL_FILE_MAIN</b> (for main bank) and

 *      ui4_channel_id field. However, the second argument of the custom search
 *      compare function is not a complete SVL record structure but only a VOID *
 *      field, whose value is assigned to the given channel ID when calling
 *      x_svl_iterate_rec(). To be consistent between sort and search compare
 *      functions, global custom compare functions shall use the channel ID for
 *      comparision.
 *  @par
 *      What if we want customized sort orders by fields other than channel ID for
 *      local SVL handles? @ref x_svl_get_rec_by_brdcst_type "x_svl_get_rec_by_*()" API's
 *      are not affected, but x_svl_iterate_rec() will be. To solve this, two API's
 *      are introduced: x_svl_iterate_rec_by_custom_ord() and x_svl_sort_rec().
 *  @par
 *      Rather than requiring a channel ID for locating the pivot,
 *      x_svl_iterate_rec_by_custom_ord() expects a VOID * pv_data, which will be
 *      passed the custom search compare function. Differing from x_svl_iterate_rec(),
 *      x_svl_iterate_rec_by_custom_ord() does not automatically sort SVL, and
 *      x_svl_sort_rec() shall be invoked before calling
 *      x_svl_iterate_rec_by_custom_ord() for manual sorting. In this way finding the
 *      next SVL record on specified direction in custom order could be realized.

 *  @subsection ssecMW_SVL_4_8  4.8. Load / save / delete the SVL object (list) to / from file system
 *  @par
 *      This topic is simple enough to omit specific examples. See the function
 *      description of x_svl_fs_sync(), x_svl_fs_store() & x_svl_fs_del(), as well as
 *      @ref ssecMW_SVL_3_6 .
 *  @par
 *  @subsection ssecMW_SVL_4_9  4.9. Backup / restore the SVL object (list) to / from memory
 *  @par
 *      In some projects, application needs to provide options for user to rollback
 *      the channel scan result after scan is completed or canceled. In this case we
 *      can backup the SVL and related lists to memory using x_svl_dump_to_mem() and
 *      alike, and perform rollback action using x_svl_load_from_mem() etc. The
 *      memory dumps shall be initialized using x_svl_init_mem_dump() before dumping,
 *      and freed using x_svl_free_mem_dump() after the dump data is no longer used.
 *  @par
 *      Here is a sample usage.
 *  @par
 *      @skip Memory
 *      @until free_mem
 *      @until CHK_FAIL
 *  @par
 *      The advantage of abovementioned in-memory backup / restore operations over
 *      traditional method of using another SVL list object for backup usage is:
 *      -#  The operation is simpler and faster.
 *      -#  Possible defects in the merging process could be avoided.
 *      -#  @ref groupMW_SVL_BLDR "SVL Builder" people are happy not to maintain a separate
 *      backup / restore procedure.

 *  @subsection ssecMW_SVL_4_10  4.10. Get / set the client data of SVL record
 *  @par
 *      Some customer projects requires to store extra channel-specific information to
 *      flash, which is not part of @ref SVL_REC_T "SVL record structure" . In this case
 *      x_svl_set_client_data() and x_svl_get_client_data() could be used.
 *  @par
 *      A simple usage example is as follows.
 *  @par
 *      @skip Client
 *      @until are set
 *  @par
 *      If application is to use SVL client data, cautions shall be taken that whether
 *      client data is supported by @ref groupMW_SVL_BLDR "SVL Builder" engines in use
 *      needs to be confirmed beforehand, as when performing update scan or monitoring
 *      service, SVL records might be updated by @ref groupMW_SVL_BLDR "SVL Builder" , but
 *      the associated client data may or may not be retained, depending on the
 *      implementation of @ref groupMW_SVL_BLDR "SVL Builder" engines.
