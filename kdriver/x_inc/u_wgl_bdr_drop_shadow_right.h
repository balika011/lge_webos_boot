/**
This command gets the preferred inset of the border. This command is helpful since when some 
attributes of the border (e.g. the shadow height) is modified, the application can gets the new 
preferred inset that is suggested by the border and then set the preferred inset by the 
WGL_CMD_GL_SET_INSET command.

Input arguments

pv_param2	Reserved. It must be NULL.

Output arguments

pv_param1	Contains the pointer of a single WGL_INSET_T buffer to receive the preferred border 
insets. Thus this argument must be of type (WGL_INSET_T *) and cannot be NULL.

Returns

WGLR_OK	The function call is successful.
