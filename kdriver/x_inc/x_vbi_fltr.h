 * Name: x_vbif_open
 *
 * Description: This API creates an instance of data filter dedicated to a specified 
 *              data type for a specified VBI source. Note that an instance of VBI 
 *              filter can only filter data with single type in a single VBI source.
 *              However, no limit is set on the number of filter instance for same
 *              data type in same VBI source. This makes multiple clients in the system 
 *              possible to acquire the same VBI data concurrently.
 *              
 *              When the opening process is finished, the notify function 
 *              (*x_vbif_nfy_fct) will be called with e_reason=VBIF_NFY_REASON_OPENED 
 *
 * Inputs:  e_fltr_type   Specifies the type of the data filter.
 *          pv_fltr_info  Contains the parameters for opening the specified data filter.
 *                        For example, if "e_fltr_type"=FLTR_TYPE_TTX_PKT, "pv_fltr_info"
 *                        shall point to a structure with type (FLTR_INIT_TTX_PKT_T *).
 *          e_src_type    Specifies the type of the VBI source.
 *          pv_src_info   Contains the parameters for opening the specified VBI source.
 *                        For example, if e_src_type == VBIF_SRC_TYPE_DIG_VBI_ES, 
 *                        pv_src_info should point to a structure 
 *                        of type (VBIF_SRC_DIG_VBI_ES_T *), which contains the parameters 
 *                        for opening the digital VBI elementary stream.
 *          e_fltr_mode   Specifies the filter mode, one of load, monitor, or Pump.
 *                           - VBIF_FLTR_MODE_LOAD : load the data, notify ONLY once and 
 *                                                   notify ONLY when data is first received.
 *                           - VBIF_FLTR_MODE_MONITOR : monitor the content of data, notify 
 *                                                      whenever data is changed
 *                           - VBIF_FLTR_MODE_PUMP : pump the data to client whenever data
 *                                                   is received.
 *          pv_nfy_tag    Contains the notify tag value.
 *          pf_nfy        References the notify function.
 *
 * Outputs: ph_filter     Contains a handle which references the newly created 
 *                        data filter instance.
 *          pe_cond       Contains the pointer to a variable to hold the newly created 
 *                        filter's condition. This argument can be NULL.
 *
 * Returns: VBIFR_OK                        Routine successful.
 *          VBIFR_INV_ARG                   Invalid arguments.
 *          VBIFR_NOT_SUPPORT_FLTR_TYPE     Filter type not supported.
 *          VBIFR_NOT_SUPPORT_SRC_TYPE      Source type not supported.
 *          VBIFR_NOT_SUPPORT_FLTR_MODE     Filter mode not supported.
 *          VBIFR_OUT_OF_MEMORY             Out of memory.
 *          VBIFR_INTERNAL_ERROR            Internal error.
 *          < 0                             Other error.

 * Name: x_vbif_close
 *
 * Description: This API closes a data filter instance. No matter this API is called 
 *              in which condition, VBI filter will automatically close itself. 
 *              For example, if this API is called when VBI filter is in VBIF_COND_STARTED,
 *              VBI filter would then automatically go through VBIF_COND_STOPPING, 
 *              VBIF_COND_OPENED, VBIF_COND_CLOSING, and finally VBIF_COND_CLOSED.
 *              During the closing process, the notify function (*x_vbif_nfy_fct) will be 
 *              called with e_cond == <VBIF_COND_***> and e_reason == NFY_REASON_COND_CHANGED,
