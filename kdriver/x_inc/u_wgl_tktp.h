The Ticker Tape widget presents the message by horizontally and smoothly scrolling the text. Besides, by optionally specifying some Ticker Tape widget styles, the message can be repeatedly scrolled around the viewport or stopped scrolling after one cycle.

This command makes the Ticker Tape widget hidden if it is originally visible in one of the following manners. The hiding mode has to be specified in the argument pv_param1.

 	WGL_TKTP_HIDE_IMMEDIATELY mode

 	Immediately hides the widget

 	WGL_TKTP_HIDE_AFTER_SCRL_ONCE mode

 	In case the messages text is scrolling in its first cycle, this command hides the widget in an asynchronous manner and the hiding request is postponed until the text has been scrolled once. 

 	In case the messages text is scrolling in its second or more cycle, the widget will be hidden immediately. 

 	In case the widget is not scrolling the message text, e.g. the text is short enough to fit into the viewport and thus no need to be scrolled, this command immediately hide the widget.

Duplicated hide commands with the same hiding mode sent to a hidden Ticker Tape widget takes no effects. However, a hide command with WGL_TKTP_HIDE_IMMEDIATELY mode will override a previously issued hide command with WGL_TKTP_HIDE_AFTER_SCRL_ONCE mode, and in this case, the widget is immediately hidden by the late coming command. In addition, a destroy command WGL_CMD_TKTP_DESTROY always overrides the hide command with WGL_TKTP_HIDE_AFTER_SCRL_ONCE mode. Refer to the command WGL_CMD_TKTP_DESTROY for more information.

If the message text is scrolling and the widget is going to be hidden, the text automatically stops scrolling until next time the widget became visible.


Input arguments

pv_param1	Indicates the hiding mode with one of the following value

 	WGL_TKTP_HIDE_IMMEDIATELY

 	WGL_TKTP_HIDE_AFTER_SCRL_ONCE

This argument must be of type WGL_TKTP_HIDE_MODE_T. 

pv_param2	Contains a (VOID *) pointer indicating any data block which is transparent to the Ticker Tape widget and only meaningful to the application. The pointer will be passed in the third argument of the callback function (*wgl_tktp_nfy_fct) when the widget is going to hide itself. Note that the value in the argument pv_param2 of duplicated WGL_CMD_TKTP_HIDE commands will override that of the previous sent WGL_CMD_TKTP_HIDE commands.

Returns

pv_param1	Contains the functions pointer of type (*wgl_tktp_nfy_fct). If this argument is NULL, the Ticker Tape widget will stop issuing any notification.

pv_param2	Reserved. It must be NULL.

Returns

WGLR_OK	The function call is successful.
