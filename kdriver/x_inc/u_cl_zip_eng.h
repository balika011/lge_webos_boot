 *              value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a
 *              filter (or predictor), Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no
 *              string match), or Z_RLE to limit match distances to one (run-length
 *              encoding). Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat
 *              random distribution. In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to
 *              compress them better. The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more Huffman
 *              coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between
 *              Z_DEFAULT and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY. Z_RLE is designed to be almost as fast as
 *              Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY, but give better compression for PNG image data. The strategy
