 	ui2_len_str: indicates the length of the UTF16_T string. Note that the field is counted in UTF16_T character unit. Note that this field cannot exceed (ui2_size_buf-1).


If an empty string is to be set:

 	ui2_size_buf: must be zero 

 	w2s_str: must be NULL 

 	ui2_len_str: must be zero.


Input arguments

pv_param1	Contains the id of the specified section. This argument must be of type UINT16 and the specified section must be a text section.

pv_param2	Specifies the text contained in the WGL_HTS_STRING_T structure. Note that the string is copied into the internal buffer of the Hyper Text widget, therefore the application doesn't need to permanently keep the string after this command. For example, the buffer of the string can be allocated in stack, instead of x_mem_alloc() API. Note that the argument must be of type (WGL_HTS_STRING_T *) and cannot be NULL.

Returns

WGLR_OK	The function call is successful.

WGLR_INV_ARG	In one of the following cases:
 	The section id is invalid
 	The argument pv_param2 is NULL
 	The string information contained in the argument pv_param2 is invalid.

Before retrieving the text, the fields of WGL_HTS_STRING_T structure should be set as following:
