 * Description: 
 *   This header file contains exported API for to store and retrive
 *   object from the mini-buffer [an object is an array of bytes.]
 *
 *   The mini-buffer provides API to store object in the buffer
 *   (x_mem_buf_write_obj()).  On success,
 *   this API returns object ID (integer value) which application can
 *   use to retrive the object (get a copy) or to delete this object from
 *   the mini-buffer.
