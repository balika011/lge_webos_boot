NULL value of this argument indicates the default inset of this border will be used.

pv_param2	Not used. This argument must be NULL.

/**
This command sets the foreground color, background color or other type of color defined in 
specific border. The type of color to be set is indicated in pv_param1. The type of color-set and 
the value of the color-set are specified in pv_param2, which is the pointer of the structure 
WGL_COLOR_INFO_T. Note that the choice of the color-set (WGL_COLOR_SET_BASIC, 
WGL_COLOR_SET_STANDARD or WGL_COLOR_SET_EXTEND) depends on which type of the border's host widget
. For example, if the border's host widget is an Icon widget, which has three states: disabled, 
enabled, and focused, it's strongly recommended to choose the color-set type 
WGL_COLOR_SET_STANDARD. If the border's host widget is a Button widget, which has an additional 
state: pushed state, it's recommended to choose the color-set type WGL_COLOR_SET_EXTEND. 

Input arguments

pv_param1	Contains the target type of color to be set. Some available color targets are such as 
WGL_CLR_BDR_BK and WGL_CLR_BDR_FG. More color targets are independently available for each type 
of border. For example, "uniform border" has additional specific color targets such as 
WGL_CLR_BDR_UNFM_INNER_BK, WGL_CLR_BDR_UNFM_TITLE_TEXT, or WGL_CLR_BDR_UNFM_TITLE_TEXT_BK. Note 
that the specific color targets can only be applied on the corresponding border component. For 
more information about the available target color types that are general for all types of borders
, refer to the section "General Border Color Command Target". For the specific color targets for 
each border, refer to the "Border Color Command Target" section in each border's documentation.

pv_param2	Contains the color information. This argument must be of type (WGL_COLOR_INFO_T *). If 
this argument is NULL, the default color will be used. For more information about the structure 
WGL_COLOR_INFO_T, refer to the document "SW Design Middleware - WGL Common Widget". Note that the 
choice of the color-set (WGL_COLOR_SET_BASIC, WGL_COLOR_SET_STANDARD or WGL_COLOR_SET_EXTEND)

Returns

WGLR_OK	The command is successful.
