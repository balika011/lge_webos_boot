 * @par Description: 
 *   This header file contains exported API for to
 *   store and retrive character string from the mini-buffer.
 *
 *   The mini-buffer provides API to store char string (NULL terminated)
 *   string in the buffer (x_str_buf_write_string()).  On success,
 *   this API returns string ID (integer value) which application can
 *   use to retrive the string (get a copy) or to delete this string from
 *   the mini-buffer.
